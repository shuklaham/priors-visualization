No calcified stones. No\nbiliary ductal dilatation.\n \nPancreas: Increased size of a nonspecific pancreatic body cystic lesion,\nmeasuring 3.1 x 1.9 cm, previously 1.2 x 0.6 cm on 5/23/2000.\nAdditionally there is a new 1 cm pancreatic head cystic lesion anterior\nto the common bile duct (series 2, image 49). No pancreatic duct\ndilatation. No peripancreatic fat stranding.\n \nSpleen: Stable benign type calcifications along the superior and\nanterior aspects of the spleen, perhaps related to remote trauma. Normal\nsize spleen.\n \nAdrenal glands: Stable 1.2 cm nodular lesion in the left adrenal gland,\nmeasures less than 10 Hounsfield units on this noncontrast CT, which is\ncompatible with an adrenal adenoma. Additionally there is a stable\nnodular lesion in the right adrenal gland, measures 26 Hounsfield units\non this noncontrast CT; given stability since CT 5/23/2000, this is\ncompatible with a benign lesion such as a lipid poor adrenal adenoma.\n \nKidneys: Multiple bilateral renal cysts. Several punctate nonobstructing\nbilateral renal calculi within the left lower pole and right upper pole.\nNo hydronephrosis. \nUrinary bladder: Foley catheter visualized within the collapsed urinary\nbladder.\nProstate/seminal vesicles: Unremarkable.\n \nBowel: Moderate diverticulosis in the sigmoid and descending colon. No\nevidence of pericolonic inflammation to suggest acute diverticulitis. No\nintra-abdominal fluid collection suggestive of abscess.
